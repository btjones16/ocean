Description: This package contains a set of functions for manipulating and 
  visualizing output from numerical ocean models. Many of the routines are 
  targeted towards Lagrangian particle-tracking models with the data stored
  in NetCDF files. There is also minimal support for generating input files
  for the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model and interacting with Fortran
  binary files. This package may be useful to spatial marine ecologists and
  biological or physical oceanographers.
